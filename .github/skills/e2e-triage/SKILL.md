# E2E Triage

## When To Use

- After `android-e2e.mjs`, `android-ocr-e2e.mjs`, or `android-photo-recipe-e2e.mjs` fails.
- When a report exists but the user should not have to inspect raw JSON.

## Procedure

1. Run `pnpm agent:triage:e2e -- --file <result-json>`.
2. Review the failing cases, inferred hints, and recovery steps.
3. If the issue is environment-related, fix the environment first and rerun the same suite.
4. If the issue is product-related, narrow to the owning code path and validate the same suite again after the fix.
