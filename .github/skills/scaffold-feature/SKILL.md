# Scaffold Feature

## When To Use

- Before implementing a new feature that spans multiple packages.
- When the agent should propose a concrete file map instead of rediscovering the same structure.

## Procedure

1. Run `pnpm agent:scaffold -- --name <feature-name> --surfaces mobile,server,shared,docs`.
2. Use the generated file plan and checklist as the implementation anchor.
3. Keep the plan small and tie each surface back to the relevant docs before coding.
